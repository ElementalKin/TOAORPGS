Player will be a store owner who has to sell the items. The way this would work is that the player would send out adventurers to gather items then way this would work is that it would create a set of random variables that will be compared to a list a attributes.
(ie. sending out an adventurer to gather items for x gold and they bring back a rusted steel great sword and then selling the items collected for y gold for a profit).

The way that adventurers will work is that there will diffrent tiers of adventurers that you send out affects the quality of items they bring back. 
(ie. adept adventurer billy will bring back lower quality items then master adventurer bob).

The way items will have random stats that will determin the value of the item, it will also have some flavor text added to the item. 
(ie. "Wooden sword of fire has a value of 25 gold" with flavor text saying "This is a wooden sword that has the enchantment of fire on it)

The way that selling items will work is that the player would insert the price that they want to sell an item for, the game will compare the value the player wants to sell the item for and the actual value of the item, if the price the player set is less than the value then it will increase the the chance that the item will be purchased if its more than the value of the item than it decreases the chance that the item will be purchased.
(ie. If the item is a chipped wooden sword will have a value 5 gold and the player wants to sell it for 7 gold then the chance that the item will be sold will be lowered but the player wants to sell it for 3 gold then it will increase the chance that it will be sold)
